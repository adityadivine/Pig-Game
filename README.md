- If the player rolls a **2–6**, the number is added to their **current round score**.
- If the player rolls a **1**, their **current round score is reset** and the turn passes to the other player.
- The player can **choose to HOLD** and **add the round score to their total score**.
- First player to reach a set winning score (e.g., **100**) wins the game!
